I just had an idea for our page keys. Since each key must be unique, maybe we could set up some rules for how we assign keys based on page type. I'm thinking maybe something like interests get prime numbered keys, groups get square numbered keys, pets get everything else i.e. nonsquare composite numbers?

Let me know what you guys think.
